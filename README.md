# spg.jl 

This file contains the implementation of the Spectral Projected Gradient Method (SPG). Additionally, it contains the GLL and BMR nonmonotone linear searches.

## Function spg:
Implements the Spectral Projected Gradient Method (SPG). It takes the following parameters:

- x0 (Vector): The initial point.
- f (Function): The objective function to be minimized.
- gradf (Function): The gradient of the objective function.
- proj (Function): The projection function.
- tol (Float64): The convergence tolerance.
- maxiter (Int): The maximum number of iterations allowed.
- lambda_min (Float64): The minimum value for the lambda parameter.
- lambda_max (Float64): The maximum value for the lambda parameter.
- M (Int): Parameter (integer number greater than zero) determining the history size for backtracking.
- sigma1 (Float64): Parameter used in quadratic interpolation.
- sigma2 (Float64): Parameter used in quadratic interpolation.
- gamma (Float64): Sufficient decrease parameter.
- linesearch (Function): The line search function.

Functions spg1 and spg2:
Backtracking routines for the SPG method: GLL and BMR. They take the same parameters as the spg function, except for the linesearch parameter. Each function returns the next point, the gradient at that point, the direction, a history of function values, the step size, elapsed time, and the number of objective function evaluations.

# main.jl 

## Imports and Inclusions:
The script imports necessary packages such as CUTEst for accessing optimization problems and includes essential Julia files (spg.jl).

## Configuration and Parameters:
Parameters such as problem names, dimensions, and solver settings are initialized. The script iterates over two cases of SPG (SPG1 and SPG2).

## Optimization Cycle:
For each problem, the script initializes the problem using CUTEst, defines the objective function and its gradient, and sets upper and lower bounds. The SPG method is then called with the specified parameters, and optimization is performed. Information about the optimization process is saved to a JLD2 file.

## Performance Profiles:
Performance profiles are generated based on the collected data. Profiles illustrate the percentage of solved problems as a function of the number of iterations, CPU time ratio, and function evaluations. Profiles are saved as images (performanceprofileiters.png, performanceprofiletime.png, performanceprofileevalf.png).

## Instructions for Use:
Ensure that the necessary Julia files (spg.jl) are in the same directory as the script.
Run the script using the Julia Programming Language.
After execution, performance profiles will be generated and saved as images in the current directory.
