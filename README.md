# spg.jl 

This file contains the implementation of the Spectral Projected Gradient Method (SPG). Additionally, it contains the GLL and BMR nonmonotone linear searches.

## Function spg:
Implements the Spectral Projected Gradient Method (SPG). It takes the following parameters:

- x0 (Vector): The initial point.
- f (Function): The objective function to be minimized.
- gradf (Function): The gradient of the objective function.
- proj (Function): The projection function.
- tol (Float64): The convergence tolerance.
- maxiter (Int): The maximum number of iterations allowed.
- lambda_min (Float64): The minimum value for the lambda parameter.
- lambda_max (Float64): The maximum value for the lambda parameter.
- M (Int): The value of M.
- sigma1 (Float64): The value of sigma1.
- sigma2 (Float64): The value of sigma2.
- gamma (Float64): The value of gamma.
- linesearch (Function): The line search function.
The function returns the minimization point, an error indicator, optimization information, elapsed time, and the sequence of points during optimization.

Functions spg1 and spg2:
Implement backtracking routines for the SPG method. They take the same parameters as the spg function, except for the linesearch parameter. Each function returns the next point, the gradient at that point, the direction, a history of function values, the step size, elapsed time, and the number of objective function evaluations.

Function spg1:
This function implements the backtracking routine for the SPG method with a specific update rule for the step size. It adjusts the step size based on a condition involving the function values at the current and the next points.

Function spg2:
Similar to spg1, this function also implements the backtracking routine for the SPG method but with a different update rule for the step size. It calculates the step size based on the projected gradient and a condition involving the function values.

These functions are essential components of the SPG method and are used by the main spg function to perform optimization.

# main.jl 

## Imports and Inclusions:
The script imports necessary packages such as CUTEst for accessing optimization problems and includes essential Julia files (spg.jl).

## Configuration and Parameters:
Parameters such as problem names, dimensions, and solver settings are initialized. The script iterates over two cases of SPG (SPG1 and SPG2).

## Optimization Cycle:
For each problem, the script initializes the problem using CUTEst, defines the objective function and its gradient, and sets upper and lower bounds. The SPG method is then called with the specified parameters, and optimization is performed. Information about the optimization process is saved to a JLD2 file.

## Performance Measurement:
The number of iterations, CPU time, and function evaluations are recorded for each problem and SPG variant. If an error occurs during optimization, corresponding values are set to infinity.

## Performance Profiles:
Performance profiles are generated based on the collected data. Profiles illustrate the percentage of solved problems as a function of the number of iterations, CPU time ratio, and function evaluations. Profiles are saved as images (performanceprofileiters.png, performanceprofiletime.png, performanceprofileevalf.png).

## Instructions for Use:
Ensure that the necessary Julia files (spg.jl) are in the same directory as the script.
Run the script using the Julia interpreter.
After execution, performance profiles will be generated and saved as images in the current directory.

## Remark:
The script provides insights into the performance of the SPG Method across a range of optimization problems.
